2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin waveform/state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin waveform/state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock instance_name/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin instance_name/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O, clk0/clk, instance_name/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/counter_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/counter_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/counter_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/counter_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/counter_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/counter_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/counter_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/counter_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/counter_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/counter_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#10 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#11 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#12 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#13 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch waveform/temp_wave_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin waveform/temp_wave_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
